# alignment.rb - Alignment support functions

# Returns a list of alignments of two lists of sentences. The alignment
# is done automatically, but takes into account the +unalignable+ flag
# on sentences, and any +sentence_alignment+ associations that already
# exist. The +sentence_alignment+ associations make up a list of sentence
# pairs which has to be monotonic for the function to function properly.
# Also, sentences with a +sentence_alignment+ association are assumed
# not to have +unalignable+ set.
# 
# +sentences1+ contains sentences from the primary source and +sentences2+
# sentences from some secondary source that should be aligned with the primary
# source. All sentences in both lists must be part of the final alignment, and
# the start and end of the two lists represent a lower and upper bounds on the
# alignment permutations.

# Returns an array of alignables, i.e. lists of sentences that are to be
