# Returns a list of alignments of two lists of sentences. If +automatic+
# is true, the alignment is done automatically, but still takes into
# account the +unalignable+ flag on sentences, and any +sentence_alignment+
# associations that already exist. The +sentence_alignment+ associations
# make up a list of sentence pairs which has to be monotonic for the
# function to function properly. Also, sentences with a
# +sentence_alignment+ association are assumed not to have +unalignable+ set.
#
# +sentences1+ contains sentences from the primary source and +sentences2+
# sentences from some secondary source that should be aligned with the primary
# source. All sentences in both lists must be part of the final alignment, and
# the start and end of the two lists represent a lower and upper bounds on the
# alignment permutations.
