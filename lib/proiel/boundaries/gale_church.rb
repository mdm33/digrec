    # Runs the Gale-Church alignment algorithm on the two sources +a+ and +b+
    # and deduces (hopefully) sensible sentence divisions by transferring
    # sentence divisions from +a+ to the corresponding locations in +b+. For
    # success, this assumes that both +a+ and +b+ contain punctuation, 
    # that this punctuation mostly occurs in the same places in +a+ and +b+,
    # and that the two sources contain approximately the same number of words.
    #
    # It is assumed that each source contains a number of chapters from
    # *one* book, i.e. the chapter numbers do not repreat. Chapter numbers 
    # are further assumed to be stable across the sources, but there does 
    # not have to be the same number of chapters in each source.
    #
    # For additional precision, the algorithm may use collocated verse 
    # boundaries and punctuation marks as additional synchronisation points.
    # This assumes that verse numbering is stable across the
    # sources. This behaviour also prevents the comparison from being
    # thrown off if source A has significant lacunae.
