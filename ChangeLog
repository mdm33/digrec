This is a history of changes that affect users and maintainers of
proiel-webapp. It does not list all changes; see the git history for that.

  - Removed the proiel:morphology:reassign task, which can be performed by
    exporting morphology, changing the exported data and re-importing it.
  - Removed task proiel:morphology:force_manual_tags. This task (which was
    broken) is easier to perform using the command-line utilities and a
    batch importer of morphology.
  - Updated ISO 639-2 language tables. This adds support for language codes
    introduced since 2013, among which is Old Lithuanian (olt).

1.9.1   12/04/2016

  - Support for <sup>, <sub> and <i> in token forms and presentation strings.

1.9.0   05/04/2016

  - Under-the-hood changes to ease transition to upcoming 2.0 version.
  - SVG is now the default for graph visualisations.
  - Added caching of frequently computed source division values. This
    introduces another scheduled job that must run regularly to keep the cache
    synchronised with changes in the database.

1.8.2   29/04/2016

  - Added workaround for sentences that are flagged as annotated or reviewed
    by lack a valid annotated_by, reviewed_by, annotated_at or reviewed_at. This
    happens, for example, when texts are exported to PROIEL XML and re-imported,
    since PROIEL XML does not include any user information.

1.8.1   15/03/2016

  - Fixed incorrect removal of parts of the export job.

1.8.0   07/03/2016

  - proiel:text:export now exports texts to the current directory by default
    unless overridden by an environment variable.
  - Exporter job has been removed since the jobs over time get too heavy to
    run without proper supervision.
  - Changed default production web server from thin to unicorn.

1.7.1   16/03/2016

  - Fixed broken tokenization of tokens with certain Unicode characters.

1.7.0   13/02/2016

  - Removed "Downloads" page.
  - Added language-specific tokenization patterns to make repetitive
    token splitting less tedious.

1.6.0   28/10/2015

  - Removed plugin system --- it was never used much.
  - Removed link mapper for Bibelen.no as site no longer uses predictable
    URLs.
  - Renamed Biblos link mapper to Biblehub.
  - Removed JSON importer and exporter. This functionality was never
    completed.
  - Added option to write an ID mapping file if importing PROIEL XML with
    existing ID attributes.
  - The following functionality has been removed and delegated to proiel-cli:
      - automatic validation of exported files
      - option to export only reviewed sentences (note that this also
        means that the files that can be downloaded from the 'Downloads'
        area now contain both reviewed and unreviewed data)
      - TigerXML and Tiger2 exporters
      - raw text importer

1.4.1   07/08/2015

  - Bug fixes
  - Updated Norse morphology
  - Support for OS X Mavericks

1.4.0   20/03/2014

  - Replaced the TEI header in the sources table and the column editor in the
    sources table with multiple metadata fields that are serialised in the
    column additional_metadata. Migration is not automatic; old TEI headers
    will be silently dropped.
  - PROIEL XML updated to version 2.0. Version 2.0 is not backwards compatible
    with version 1.0. PROIEL XML 1.0 can still be imported but all exports are
    now in PROIEL XML 2.0.
  - Split inflections.lemma into inflections.lemma and
    inflections.part_of_speech_tag for consistency.

1.3.0   05/02/2014
