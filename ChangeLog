This is a history of changes that affect users and maintainers of
proiel-webapp. It does not list all changes; see the git history for that.

1.7.0   13/02/2016

  - Removed "Downloads" page.
  - Added language-specific tokenization patterns to make repetitive
    token splitting less tedious.

  - Removed plugin system --- it was never used much.

    completed.

    existing ID attributes.
  - The following functionality has been removed and delegated to proiel-cli:
      - automatic validation of exported files

        means that the files that can be downloaded from the 'Downloads'
        area now contain both reviewed and unreviewed data)

      - raw text importer
