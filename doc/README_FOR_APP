= The PROIEL web application

== Installation

You need Rails 2.3.8 installed as a RubyGem for this application to work.

The application has a number of other dependencies that should be handled
automatically by Rails' dependency tracker. Use

    rake gems:install

to have the dependency tracker automatically install all dependencies.

You should also install +graphviz+ from link:http://www.graphviz.org/ to
get dependency graph visualisations. Version 2.26.3 is known to work with
this release of the PROIEL application. +graphviz+ must be complied with
SVG support. The recommended configuration settings are

    --with-fontconfig --with-freetype2 --with-pangocairo --with-rsvg

To be able to compile morphological rules, you will need the +SFST+ toolkit
from
link:http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html.
This release of the application is designed to work with version 1.3 of
+SFST+. As this is only required if you plan to complile new morphological
rules, this step is optional.

Before starting the application for the first time, you must run
    make -C lib
to build the support files.

== Configuring the database

Copy +config/database.yml.example+ to +config/database.yml+ and customize
if needed. The default setup creates SQLite databases in the +db+
directory.

Inititialize a new database by running

    $ rake db:setup

Add an administrator account. This should be done using Rails' console
interface:

    $ ./script/console
    Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.8)
    >> u = User.new :login => "username", :first_name => "Foo", :last_name => "Bar", :email => "foo@bar", :password => "foo"
    >> u.role_id = 4
    >> u.save!
    >> u.confirm!
