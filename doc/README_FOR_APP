= The PROIEL Corpus

== Installation

The application depends on (at least) these gems:
* xmlsimple
* unicode
* diff-lcs
* facets
* fastercsv
* memoize
* oniguruma
* password_generator
* ruby-xslt

You will also need an installation of graphviz in a path accessible to the
application.

To generate all the documentation, you will in addition need
* railroad

== Overview

The PROIEL application consists of four components
* General utilities for corpus linguistics. This is kept within the Lingua
namespace and resides in the directory <tt>lib/lingua</tt>.
* Generic PROIEL-specific functionality. This comprises all the logic that
is specific to the data model used by the PROIEL corpus, but not tied to
the web-application or database. This resides in <tt>lib/proiel</tt> and is
accessible through modules in the PROIEL namespace.
* Original source data and pre-processing scripts. This iskept in the 
<tt>data</tt> directory.
* The web-application and database specific data model. This is laid out
as a regular Ruby on Rails application. An overview of the models can be 
found here[link:../models.svg] and for the controllers 
here[link:../controllers.svg].

These components are in principle separable, but probably not in
practice, although it could be done with some effort. 

=== Rake tasks

The Ruby on Rails application includes a set of rake tasks for importing and
exporting data and for running various forms of validation jobs.

== Data sources 

=== PROIEL ad hoc XML format

The schema for the PROIEL ad hoc XML format is found in the data directory
and called text.xsd.
  :include:../data/text.xsd

==== Language tags

The language tags used are the ones listed in 
IANA's language subtag registry[http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry]
as per RFC 4646 and recommended by the W3C[http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/]. 
The tags are the following:

cu::  Old Church Slavonic (ISO 639-1: cu; ISO 639-2: chu; ISO/FDIS 639-3: chu) 
la::  Latin (ISO 639-1: la; ISO 639-2: lat; ISO/FDIS 639-3: lat)
grc:: Ancient Greek (ISO 639-1: none; ISO 639-2: grc; ISO/FDIS 639-3: grc)
hy::  Armenian (ISO 639-1: hy; ISO 639-2: hye; ISO/FDIS 639-3: hye)
got:: Gothic (ISO 639-1: none; ISO 639-2: got; ISO/FDIS 639-3: got)

In the PROIEL ad hoc XML format the xml:lang attribute is not used.
Instead an attribute lang is used, as xml:lang will fail
validation with the current combination of language tags and schemata.

== Tools

=== proiel-import

The proiel-import tools loads the baseline text for a particular source,
initialising or updating the source meta data if necessary.

== Text sources 

The PROIEL base texts were derived from a number of sources:
* MorphGNT.org[http://morphgnt.org]
* Perseus
* vulsearch
* TITUS

=== TITUS

The Church Slavonic, Gothic and Armenian texts are derived from the texts
prepared by the TITUS project. The TITUS files are available as HTML and
a proprietary format. While the HTML files are UTF-8 encoded, they cannot
be parsed reliably by an HTML parser.  The proprietary format, on the 
other hand, is parsable, but not standardly encoded. The PROIEL texts were 
therefore derived from the proprietary format, and the encoding reverse 
engineered by manual comparison with the HTML text, and may be the source
of occasional encoding errors.

= Known issues

* Dependency structure graphs occasionally appear jagged in
  Internet Explorer 6 (and perhaps 7).

  The graphs are served as PNG images, and IE has a history
  of issues in dealing with this image format. Unfortunately,
  using a different image format is not an option at the moment
  as the graphing program, graphviz, cannot generate images
  with non-Latin characters in any other reasonable image
  format than PNG. The issue may be resolved by using a more
  recent version of graphviz that supports GIF images and
  the correct fonts.
