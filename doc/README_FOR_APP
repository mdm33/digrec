= The PROIEL web application

== Installation

You need Rails 2.1.1 installed as a RubyGem for this application to work.
The application has a number of other dependencies that should be handled
automatically by Rails' dependency tracker. Use
    rake gems
to get a list of dependencies and their installation status, and
    rake gems:install
to install any missing RubyGems.

You should also install +graphviz+ to get dependency graph visualisations.
You can download it from link:http://www.graphviz.org/. Version 2.20.2 with
Pango and Cairo support enabled is recommended for this release of the PROIEL
application.

For the morphological rules, you will also need to install the +SFST+
toolkit from link:http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html.
This release of the application is designed to work with version 1.2 of
+SFST+, and will not work with version 1.3 without some tweaking.

Before starting the application for the first time, you must run
    make -C lib
to build the support files.
