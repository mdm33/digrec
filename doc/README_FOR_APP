= The PROIEL web application

== Installation

You need Rails 2.3.2 installed as a RubyGem for this application to work.

Note that you will also need RubyGems >= 1.3 to run Rails >= 2.3.2 successfully.
See link:http://afreshcup.com/2008/10/25/rails-212-and-22rc1-update-your-rubygems/
for details on how to solve this issue.

The application has a number of other dependencies that should be handled
automatically by Rails' dependency tracker. Use
    rake gems
to get a list of dependencies and their installation status, and
    rake gems:install
to install any missing RubyGems.

You should also install +graphviz+ to get dependency graph visualisations.
You can download it from link:http://www.graphviz.org/. Version 2.20.2 with
Pango and Cairo support enabled is recommended for this release of the PROIEL
application.

For the morphological rules, you will also need to install the +SFST+
toolkit from
link:http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html.
This release of the application is designed to work with version 1.3
of +SFST+.

Before starting the application for the first time, you must run
    make -C lib
to build the support files.

== Setting up the database

Copy +config/database.yml.example+ to +config/database.yml+ and customize
if needed. The default setup creates SQLite databases in the +db+
directory.

Inititialize a new database by running

    $ rake db:setup

Add an administrator account. This has to be done using Rails' console
interface:

    $ ./script/console
    Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.5)
    >> User.create! :login => "username", :first_name => "Foo", :last_name => "Bar", :email => "foo@bar", :password => "foo"
