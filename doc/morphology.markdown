Latin

### Future imperative

For lack of a more appropriate label, we employ the traditional label _future imperative_ for forms
such as _estote_ and _scitote_.

### Locative

The locative is not a legal value for the case attribute in Latin. Instances traditionally classified
as locatives should instead be annotated as genitives or ablatives. Petrified locatives such as
_ruri_ should be treated as adverbs.

### Marginal tenses

The forms _bǫdǫ_, _bǫdeši_, … are annotated as futures; _bimъ_, _bi_, … as subjunctives.
