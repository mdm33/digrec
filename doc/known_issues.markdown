Known issues
============

This is a list of known issues with the application, in particular
those that are unlikely to be fixed at any point for one reason or
another.

* Support for Internet Explorer is dodgy.

* The dependency editor can be very slow with certain browsers.
  Use version 3 or higher of Firefox if this is a problem.

* Editorial symbols are badly treated. This manifests itself as
  braces, brackets and parentheses in the middle of tokens,
  sometimes with parts split off as separate tokens, and as
  bad spacing between punctuation and tokens.
