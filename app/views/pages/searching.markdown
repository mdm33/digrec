Searching
=========

The search box in the navigation bar allows rapid access to simple
query results.

![Search dialog example](/images/help-searching.png)

The search box accepts the following types of searches:

* *Word forms and lemmata:* By entering a single word, the database
  will be queried for all word forms and lemmata matching the given
  word. The match does not have to be exact; any substring will match.

* *Sentence annotations:* By entering digits only, the search box will
  take you directly to the Annotation page for the sentence with the
  given ID.

* *Text passages:* By entering a text reference on the form `Source
  Book`, e.g. `GNT Mark`, you will be taken to the Text page for that
  location in the text.

Quick searches
--------------

If you are using Firefox, you can also perform searches directly from
the browser. To enable this feature, navigate to one of the PROIEL
pages, and look for the PROIEL icon in the Search Engine list in
Firefox. You can now perform searches simply by selecting PROIEL as
your current search engine and entering the search terms in the Search
Engine bar.
