# Font setup

For your browser to correctly render our pages, you will need fonts
that support the scripts that occur in our texts. On most modern
systems this should work fairly well without any manual intervention,
but should you see misplaced diacritics or odd-looking boxes, like in
the picture below, it is likely that you need to update your fonts.

![Bad font example](/assets/help-bad-fonts.png)

For some languages, we rely on very recent additions to the Unicode
standard (we use Unicode 5.1), which means that the range of available
fonts with full support for our character set is still limited.

## Old Church Slavonic

These are the fonts we are currently aware of that support our Old
Church Slavonic character repertoire and our system has been
configured to prefer:

 * [RomanCyrillic_Std](http://kodeks.uni-bamberg.de/AKSL/Schrift/RomanCyrillicStd.htm)
 * [Kliment Std](http://kodeks.uni-bamberg.de/AKSL/Schrift/KlimentStd.htm) (use the `Kliment_Std.ttf` font and not the
 ‘compatibility’ font `Kliment_Std_51.ttf`)
