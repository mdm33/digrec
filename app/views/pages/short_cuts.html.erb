<h1>Short-cut keys</h2>

Using access keys you can quickly navigate directly to a specific page or part
of a page using the keyboard. In most browsers you will have to hold down the
<abbr title="Control">Ctrl</abbr> and <abbr>Alt</abbr> keys and simultaneously press
one of the access keys listed below. If this does not work in your browser,
you can see if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_keys">the Wikipedia
page on Access keys</a> explains the procedure for your browser.
